          <p>Step 1: Cleanse – The Foundation of Your Skincare Routine</p>
          <p>
            Welcome back! In my previous post, we dived into how to identify
            your skin type and some common skin conditions. Today, we’re going
            to take the first step in building a solid skincare routine –
            cleansing. It’s one of the most important steps for maintaining
            healthy skin, but it’s also one that can be confusing for beginners.
            Let's simplify it!
          </p>

          <h2>Why Cleansing Matters</h2>
          <p>
            The skin on your face is more sensitive than the rest of your body
            and constantly exposed to dirt, oils, and pollutants. Cleansing
            helps remove these impurities, prevents clogged pores, and preps
            your skin for the next steps in your routine.
          </p>

          <h2>Types of Cleansers</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Water Alone</strong> – Using just water can help remove
            hydrophilic dirt, but it’s not enough to tackle oils and makeup. If
            you apply a rich cream or oil before bed, a cleanser in the morning
            is a must!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Micellar Water</strong> – A popular and gentle cleanser made
            with micelles (tiny balls of cleansing oil molecules) suspended in
            water. It’s great for removing makeup and grime without irritation.
            Pro tip: Always rinse with water afterward for best results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some great options: Bioderma Sensibio, Simple Kind to Skin Micellar
            Water
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Regular Cleansers</strong> – Most cleansers use surfactants
            to break down oil and dirt. However, harsh surfactants and high pH
            levels can strip your skin’s natural barrier, leading to irritation.
            Look for gentle cleansers with mild surfactants and a skin-friendly
            pH.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gentle options: Glossier Milky Jelly, The Ordinary Squalane
            Cleanser, Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Cleanser
          </p>

          <h2>Double Cleansing – The Game-Changer</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re dealing with excess oil, makeup, or sunscreen, oil
            cleansing is your new best friend. Double cleansing involves
            starting with an oil-based cleanser to break down stubborn oils and
            dirt, followed by a regular cleanser. It’s perfect for all skin
            types, not just dry skin!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why oil cleansing works:</strong> It draws out sebum,
            unclogs pores, and reduces irritation from harsh cleansers. You can
            use 100% cold-pressed oils or opt for a pre-made cleansing oil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cleansing oils available: L'Occitane Almond Shower Oil, Innisfree
            Camellia Nourishing Shower Oil
          </p>

          <h2>The Lazy Hack – Cleansing Oils/Balms</h2>
          <p>
            If double cleansing sounds like too much work, cleansing oils or
            balms might be your go-to. These combine both steps – massage onto
            the skin, add water to emulsify, and rinse. Voilà, clean skin in
            half the time!
          </p>

          <h2>Final Tips for Cleanser Shopping</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Check Ingredients</strong> – Use sites like COSDNA and
            InciDecoder to decode ingredients and avoid irritants.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Start Gentle</strong> – Always test new cleansers to ensure
            they don’t disrupt your skin’s barrier.
          </p>
