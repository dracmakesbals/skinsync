        <h1>How to Soothe and Treat Sensitive Skin</h1>
        <p>
          Sensitive skin requires extra care and attention to avoid irritation.
          Whether your skin reacts to certain products or environmental factors,
          a gentle, soothing routine can help keep your skin calm and
          comfortable. Here’s how you can build a sensitive skin-friendly
          routine.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Choose a Fragrance-Free, Gentle Cleanser</h2>
        <p>
          Sensitive skin is prone to irritation, so it’s important to use a
          mild, fragrance-free cleanser. Harsh ingredients or strong fragrances
          can trigger redness and irritation. Opt for a cleanser with soothing
          ingredients like glycerin or ceramides, which help maintain the skin’s
          moisture barrier while cleansing away impurities.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Hydrate with a Calming Moisturizer</h2>
        <p>
          Moisturizing is key to protecting sensitive skin from dryness and
          irritation. Look for moisturizers that contain calming ingredients
          such as aloe vera, chamomile, or oatmeal. These ingredients help
          reduce inflammation and redness. A thick, fragrance-free moisturizer
          can lock in moisture and provide a protective barrier against
          environmental irritants.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Avoid Harsh Exfoliants – Stick to Enzyme-Based Formulas</h2>
        <p>
          Exfoliation can be too harsh for sensitive skin, especially if it
          involves physical scrubs. Instead, use an enzyme-based exfoliant once
          a week to gently remove dead skin cells without irritation. Enzymes
          from fruits like papaya or pineapple are effective yet mild for
          sensitive skin. Avoid over-exfoliating, as it can lead to increased
          sensitivity.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Use a Physical (Mineral) Sunscreen</h2>
        <p>
          Sun protection is crucial, but chemical sunscreens can sometimes
          irritate sensitive skin. Opt for physical sunscreens containing zinc
          oxide or titanium dioxide. These ingredients create a protective
          shield on your skin without causing allergic reactions. Additionally,
          ensure that your sunscreen is labeled "broad-spectrum" to protect
          against both UVA and UVB rays.
        </p>

        <p>
          By following a gentle routine and avoiding common irritants, you can
          manage sensitive skin effectively. Stick to products that are designed
          for sensitive skin, and remember, less is more when it comes to
          treating sensitive skin.
